# Web Attack Repository
The **Web Attack Repository (WAR)** is a data sharing project lead by the Akamai Threat Research WAF Team.  WAR focuses on novel attack payloads used by attackers, bug bounty researchers and web applications security testing vendors that were identified on our platform.  This data set is unique and differentiates from other similar projects such as [Portswigger's Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Cheat Sheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet) as we provide payloads for other attack categories such as SQL Injection and Command Injection.  The data for each attack category is in JSON format to make it easily consumable by tools and Github webhooks make it easy for consumers to be notified of new content.
