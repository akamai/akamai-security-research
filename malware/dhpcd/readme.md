# dhpcd Campaign IoCs
This repository contains a list of IoCs to detect the dhpcd cryptominer.
You can read about the campaign in this blogpost.
## Content List
* File names related to dhpcd cryptomining capmaign
* File hashes 
* The mining pool domain list that the cryptominer used on Akamai threat sensors network
* A bash script to detect dhpcd activity on linux machines.

## Detection Script - dhpcd_detection.sh
### Running the script
To run the script, open a Linux terminal and run:
```
./dhpcd_detection.sh
```

### Script Results
The script tests 4 parameters:
* Is the process running?
* Binary path exist?
* Persistency 
* Backdoor

The script will print which parameters were found on the machine and eventually print the result - whether the machine is infected or not.
