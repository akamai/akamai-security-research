# CVE-2022-31461 & CVE-2023-31462 - LPE Vulnerabilites in SteelSeriesGG Application
This is the git repository for our research into CVE-2023-31461 and CVE-2023-31462.

For more information about the vulnerability and its exploitation check out [our blog](http://akamai.com/blog/security-research/exploit-steelseries-subapp-privilege-escalation).

To use the code you will need either a DLL that exports the same functions as SSDEVICE.dll, and SteelSeriesEngine.exe or setup an envrionment for the TOCTOU vector.

The code should be executed in two phases:
1) The code should be executed with `POST /subApps` in the headers and a path traversal value in the `name` object, this will create the subApp.
2) The code should be executed with `POST /subApps/status` and `IsEnabled:true` in order to start the execution of the subApp.
